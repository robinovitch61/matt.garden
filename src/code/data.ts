    name: "Sunflower",
    latinName: "Helianthus Annuus",
    text: "Welcome to Matt's Garden! Each day a new plant grows in this internet space. This first day brings the Sunflower. The fuzzy brown centers of sunflowers are actually individual tiny flowers. Even the petals on a sunflower are individual flowers. Tap on or hover over this flower to  make it blush!",

    name: "Mossy Rock",
    latinName: "Mossius Rockus",
    text: "Mosses (mossi?) play a vital role in the development of new ecosystems. They're among the first plant colonisers of disturbed sites, such as when an area is deforested or affected by forest fires. They stabilise the soil surface and retain water, helping new plants to grow. Plus, they're hella soft and colorful.",

    name: "Lemon Tree",
    latinName: "Citrus Limon",
    text: "Lemons are technically berries! James Lind carried out the first randomized controlled trial in 1747 when investigating scurvy. He fed different diets to 6 groups of scurvy-laden sailors. The group that got lemons and oranges were soon well enough to care for the others. This is why sailors' diets today consist only of lemons!",

    name: "California Bay Laurel",
    latinName: "Umbellularia Californica",
    text: "Bay Laurel leaves have been used for medicine for centuries. The Pomo and Yuki tribes of Mendocino County treated headaches by placing a single leaf in the nostril or bathing the head with a laurel leaf infusion. A tea was made from the leaves to treat stomach aches, colds, sore throats, and to clear up mucus in the lungs. The leaves were steeped in hot water to make an infusion that was used to wash sores. I've also heard that they make great temporary patches for bike tires in a pinch!",

    name: "Lemongrass",
    latinName: "Cymbopogon",
    text: "In Hoodoo, or 'Lowcountry Voodoo', lemongrass is the primary ingredient of van van oil, one of the most popular oils used in conjure. Lemongrass is used in this preparation and on its own in hoodoo to protect against evil, spiritually clean a house, and to bring good luck in love affairs. This explains why Thai Food for a date is a great bet.",

    latinName: "Cactaceae",
    text: "Despite their cute and fuzzy appearance, cacti deserve a healthy amount of respect. In 1984, two Arizonan roommates took to shooting the nearby Saguaros with a shotgun for fun. Shooting at a 26 foot tall Saguaro caused a section of the cactus to fall and crushed one of the gunmen to death!",

  {
    name: "Fig Tree",
    latinName: "Ficus Carica",
    text: "The unique fruits of the fig tree date back to ancient Greece, where white figs were worn by women and black figs were worn by men for purification rituals. Aristotle imagined an inquiry that begins with questions such as ‘Why do fig trees and grape vines lose their leaves?’. The model answer is ‘Because they are both broad-leafed.’ That is, the inquiry seeks some other feature, common to both kinds, related to the target of inquiry, the seasonal loss of leaves. The ‘because’ is, however, preliminary—it is best to see being broad-leafed as a step toward causal explanation. Chapter 17 picks up the example, in the context of arguing that basic scientific inquiry seeks, wherever possible, co-extensive predications, which those between leaf loss and fig trees, or leaf loss and grape vines, are not. The candidate major premise, however—‘Whatever is broad-leafed loses its leaves’—does identify a co-extensive relationship between subject and predicate. It may thus serve as a proper scientific explanandum, and ‘broad-leafed’ can serve to identify a kind, all and only the members of which lose their leaves.[3] Thus, the middle term of the preliminary explanation becomes the subject of a more basic, co-extensive predication. The cause of broad-leafed trees losing their leaves will, then, be something more fundamental about broad-leafed trees, here identified as the solidification of moisture at the leaf juncture, which can thus serve as the middle term in a causal explanation of this fact. But it will also serve as part of a definition of leaf loss. Reading this was time well spent, wouldn't you agree?",

    name: "Passionfruit",
    latinName: "Passiflora Edulis",
    text: "The several varieties of passion fruit are generally purple or yellow in color. Within the berry, there are typically 250 black seeds, each 2.4 mm in length. This means it would only require 640,666,667 passionfruit berries in order to stack their seeds all the way from the Earth to the Moon!",

    name: "Fern",
    latinName: "Polypodiopsida",
    text: "Ferns have been around for nearly 400 million years. Fossil fuels (coal and natural oils) created during Carboniferous period are mostly made of ferns. Fern leaves are called 'fronds' and they uncurl from 'croziers'. There are somewhere between 12 and 20 thousand different fern species around today!",

  {
    name: "Monstera Deliciosa",
    latinName: "Delicious Monster",
    text: "Deliciosa means 'delicious', referring to their edible fruit. Monstera means 'monstrous', in reference to their size - over 9m (30ft) in many cases! In the wild, Monstera Deliciosa has incredibly rich fruit. It tastes like a combination of strawberries, passionfruit, mango, and pineapple (but only when blended in a smoothie with strawberries, passionfruit, mango and pineapple).",
